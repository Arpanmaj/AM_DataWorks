# Demo Projects for Data Entry & Formatting

This repository showcases a collection of **demo projects** designed to demonstrate my skills in **data entry**, **data cleaning**, and **data formatting**. Each project reflects realistic client requests and highlights my ability to organize and present data accurately and in a user-friendly manner.

## Key Features:
- Data entry and cleaning (error correction, removal of duplicates, etc.)
- Excel formatting (font adjustments, grid designs, color coding, etc.)
- Special functions used (data validation, calculations, charts, etc.)
- Conversion of data files (e.g., Excel to PDF)
  
The repository contains individual folders for each project, where you can find:
1. **Raw Data Files** – Example data provided by the client (e.g., PDFs, Excel templates, etc.).
2. **Formatted Data** – Cleaned, organized, and formatted data according to project requirements.
3. **Client Requests (README)** – A detailed description of the client’s expectations for each project.
4. **Work Done (README)** – A summary of the steps I took to transform the data, including data cleaning, formatting, and any special tools used.

Feel free to explore each project folder to get a comprehensive understanding of my work process and the level of attention to detail I bring to each task. These projects also act as references for potential clients to assess my ability to work with data effectively and deliver clear, organized outputs.
